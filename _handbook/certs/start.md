## Overview

Getting certification is one of the most daunting parts of shipping a hardware product and it's easy to rapidly go from zero to overwhelming! It typically costs a tremendous amount of money per round of testing, with it being reported that [approximately 50% of products fail their first time](https://emcfastpass.com/ce-mark-guide-electronics/).

Most of these tests have to do with Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) which is mainly related to electronics. There are a whole host of tests that check other things like water or dust ingress, shock, or vibration, but EMC tests are the ones that mainly prevent a product from being sold on the market, so that's what we're focusing on in this section.

This section is broken into a few parts:

- Types of Certifications
- Determining What Tests and Certs You Need
- Design to Pass
- Going in for Testing
- Marking Your Device
